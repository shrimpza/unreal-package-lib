# Unreal Archive

## TODO

- Iteration 1
  - Sync existing/offline file archives to cloud storage
  - Generate simple file index/listing, allowing download of content
- Iteration 2
  - Support file uploads from users
  - Incorporate uploaded files in file index

- Keep in mind
  - Allow complete download of entire archive, ensures resilience to host going
    down or maintenance issues

- Future Iterations
  - Knowledge base/documentation
  - File categorisation, browse, search, images, and other media (nexus mods- 
    like for Unreal?)
